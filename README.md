# Phase-Stability-Tool-for-High-Entropy-Alloys
This tool has been created to understand the single phase stability of high entropy alloys, tool can also be used to create high entropy alloy model for molecular dynmaics simulation in LAMMPS. I will try to develop this code with new features in future. The code language is created with Python 3 language.
